<!--- Short introduction{: .prompt-info } --->



 	I am an avid cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on red-teaming and penetration testing. I actively engage in weekly capture the flag (CTF) events, where I continually strive to enhance my knowledge and refine my skills. Ranking in the top 1% on TryHackMe and holding the #4 spot in King of the Hill (KOTH) competitions showcases my dedication and proficiency.
