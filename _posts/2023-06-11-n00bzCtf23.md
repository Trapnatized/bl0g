A few challenges for the n00bzCTF23


<br/>

# Forensics
## Crack & Crack
This is a forensics challenge where we have to crack a few passwords.

![](image 27.png)

First we download the **`flag.zip`** file and if we try to unzip it we'll need a password.

Since we dont have the password we will try to crack it using a tool called **`fcrack`**.

And we get a password. Let's unzip this file.

![](image 4 2.png)

It's a .pdf file that's also password protected.

Let's crack this password also, we will use **`john`** aka JohnTheRipper. 

First we will make a hash of the .pdf file using **`pdf2john`** and write that to a new file called pdf.hash.

Next we will run **`john`** with a password list against the pdf.hash

And we get a password to unlock flag.pdf

# OSINT
## Mission Moon

Downloading the **`mission_moon.webp`** file we get this picture.

If we utilize google's image search we can look for any images of this picture that google has info on.

Since our challenge told us to use the longitude and latitude from **`blog.jatan.space`** we will find image source and use that blog for the info.

Searching on that blog post we find all the information we need to craft our flag.

## Damn

Downloading the **`dam.png`** we get this picture.

![](image 9.png)

We will use **`TinEye`** for this one.

I then looked up what city the nova kakhovka dam was in.

Come to find out the flag was
 
**n00bz{Nova_Kakhovka}**|

<br/>

## Lost

![](image 13.png)

We are going to do the same process, download the file and use google image search.

![](image 15.png)


The picture is a little distorted so it's hard to tell if this is a match but let's examine the picture for any thing that stands out. Immediatly my eyes went to this building.

![](image 16.png)

Looking at the google result we can see the same building and the Golden Gate bridge in the background so this has to be the spot.

![](image 17.png)

![](image 18.png)

Now looking back at the google result we see there's also and address from where this picture was taken **`1200 kearny st`**. so let's google map this address and get our flag.

## Try to hack me

>**I didn't get to solve this challenge in time... I was under the impression I needed to login, as the credentials were different.**
>**Then they updated challenge with 2 hints and new creds. By the time I tried again the CTF was over**

![](image 26.png)


If we search for the username **`brayannoob`** on google we dont get much useful information. But if we search Github we actually find a user under that name.

![](image 21.png)

If we check out the recent commits we can see the recent changes made to this repository. And we see there was a change made yesterday.

![](image 22.png)

Digging into this commit we see a new username **`brayan234`**

![](image 23.png)


From the name of this challenge it reminds me of the website **`https://tryhackme.com`** . Let's look for brayan234 on Tryhackme.


![](image 24.png)

And we now have the flag.
